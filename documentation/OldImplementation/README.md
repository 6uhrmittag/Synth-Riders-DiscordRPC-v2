## Features

- Detailed Discord RPC based on the output of https://github.com/bookdude13/SynthRiders-Websockets-Mod
- Show Album Artwork of the currently playing song
- Automatic launch on startup
    - Allows the RPC application to start automatically when the user logs in, removing the need to manually start the application

## Installing

1. Install the [Synth Riders Websockets Mod](https://github.com/bookdude13/SynthRiders-Websockets-Mod)
    1. (For instructions see the mod's README.md).
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/6uhrmittag/Synth-Riders-DiscordRPC/releases/latest)
3. Run the setup executable
4. Go through the setup process
5. You're done!

You may delete the setup executable after installation

## Usage

1. Simply run the RPC application like any other program

### Advanced configuration

The configuration file is located at `%localappdata%\Synth Riders DiscordRPC\config\config.json`

See the code for details on what each setting does:

- `config.py`
- `src\utilities\rpc\assets.py`

### Album Artwork Upload

To show the current song's album artwork in Discord, it's uploaded to the temporary file hosting: [uguu.se](https://uguu.se/)  
The artwork used is the one provided by the Synth Riders Websockets Mod; this way it works with all maps that have artwork.

The upload-url can be changed in the configuration file; it should work with all [uguu](https://github.com/topics/uguu) and [pomf-based](https://github.com/topics/pomf) file hosting services.  
The covers are usually around 100-500kb in size, and they get deleted after 3h - so minimal overhead.

## Building from source

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Increase the version number in `config.py`
4. Run `build.bat`
5. The executable will be located in the `dist/` directory
