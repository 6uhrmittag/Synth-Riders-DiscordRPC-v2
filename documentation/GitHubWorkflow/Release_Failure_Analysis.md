# Release Action Failure Analysis

## Issues Identified

### 1. File Path Mismatch
**Error**: 
```
ü§î Pattern 'dist/main.exe' does not match any files.
ü§î Pattern 'dist/main' does not match any files.
```

**Root Cause**: The release action is looking for files in `dist/` but the build artifacts are downloaded to `windows-dist/` and `linux-dist/` directories.

**Fix Applied**: Updated file paths to match the downloaded artifact locations.

### 2. Permission Error (403)
**Error**:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è GitHub release failed with status: 403
```

**Root Cause**: The GitHub token doesn't have sufficient permissions to create releases.

**Fix Applied**: Added `permissions: contents: write` to the release job.

### 3. Outdated Action Version
**Issue**: Using `softprops/action-gh-release@v1` which is outdated.

**Fix Applied**: Updated to `softprops/action-gh-release@v2`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Action Version
```yaml
# Before
- uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1

# After
- uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
```

### 2. Added Permissions
```yaml
# Added to release job
permissions:
  contents: write
```

### 3. Fixed File Paths
```yaml
# Build workflow (separate artifacts)
files: |
  windows-dist/main.exe
  linux-dist/main

# CI workflow (direct artifacts)
files: |
  dist/main.exe
  dist/main
```

### 4. Added Error Handling
```yaml
# Added to prevent failure on missing files
fail_on_unmatched_files: false
```

## File Path Differences

### Build Workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`)
- Downloads artifacts to separate directories
- Uses `windows-dist/main.exe` and `linux-dist/main`

### CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
- Uses artifacts directly from build jobs
- Uses `dist/main.exe` and `dist/main`

## Permission Requirements

According to the documentation, the release action requires:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
```

This permission allows the action to:
- Create releases
- Upload assets
- Manage release tags

## Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. Verify File Existence
Check if the files exist in the expected locations:

```bash
# For build workflow
ls -la windows-dist/
ls -la linux-dist/

# For CI workflow
ls -la dist/
```

### 2. Check Permissions
Ensure the workflow has proper permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
```

### 3. Verify Token
Make sure the GitHub token has sufficient permissions:
- Go to repository settings
- Check Actions permissions
- Ensure "Read and write permissions" is selected

### 4. Debug File Paths
Add debug steps to verify file locations:

```yaml
- name: Debug file locations
  run: |
    echo "Current directory: $(pwd)"
    echo "Directory contents:"
    ls -la
    echo "Dist contents:"
    ls -la dist/ || echo "dist/ not found"
    echo "Windows-dist contents:"
    ls -la windows-dist/ || echo "windows-dist/ not found"
    echo "Linux-dist contents:"
    ls -la linux-dist/ || echo "linux-dist/ not found"
```

## Alternative Approaches

### 1. Use Wildcards
Instead of specific file names, use wildcards:

```yaml
files: |
  windows-dist/*.exe
  linux-dist/main*
```

### 2. Copy Files to Standard Location
Copy files to a standard location before release:

```yaml
- name: Prepare release files
  run: |
    mkdir -p release
    cp windows-dist/main.exe release/
    cp linux-dist/main release/
    
- name: Create Release
  uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
  with:
    files: |
      release/main.exe
      release/main
```

### 3. Use Relative Paths
Ensure paths are relative to the workspace:

```yaml
files: |
  ./windows-dist/main.exe
  ./linux-dist/main
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Add Permissions
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
```

### 2. Use Latest Action Version
```yaml
- uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v2
```

### 3. Handle Missing Files Gracefully
```yaml
fail_on_unmatched_files: false
```

### 4. Debug File Paths
Add debug steps to verify file locations before release.

### 5. Use Conditional Releases
Only create releases on specific events:

```yaml
if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
```

## Expected Results

After these fixes, the release action should:
1. ‚úÖ Find the executable files in the correct locations
2. ‚úÖ Have sufficient permissions to create releases
3. ‚úÖ Use the latest action version with better error handling
4. ‚úÖ Create releases with proper assets attached

## Monitoring

### Success Indicators
- Release created with tag `v{version}`
- Assets uploaded successfully
- No permission errors (403)
- No file not found errors

### Failure Indicators
- 403 permission errors
- File not found errors
- Missing assets in release
- Action version deprecation warnings
