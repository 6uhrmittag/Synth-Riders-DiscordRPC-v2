# Windows Installer Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved

The original issue was that the GitHub releases were missing the `settings` directory containing `appinfo.ini` and `config.json`, which are essential for the application to function properly.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Release File Inclusion
**Problem**: Release only contained `main.exe`, missing settings files
**Solution**: Updated release workflow to include entire distribution directories

```yaml
# Before
files: |
  windows-dist/main.exe
  linux-dist/main

# After
files: |
  windows-dist/
  linux-dist/
```

### 2. Created Professional Windows Installer
**Technology**: NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System)
**Features**:
- Professional setup wizard with multiple pages
- Automatic installation of all required files
- System integration (start menu, desktop, autorun)
- Proper uninstaller with registry cleanup
- Version management and branding

## Files Created
